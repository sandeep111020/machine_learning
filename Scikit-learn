Scikit-learn is a library in Python that provides many unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms. Itâ€™s built upon some of the technology you might already be familiar with, like NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib!

The functionality that scikit-learn provides include:

Regression, including Linear and Logistic Regression
Classification, including K-Nearest Neighbors
Clustering, including K-Means and K-Means++
Model selection
Preprocessing, including Min-Max Normalization
